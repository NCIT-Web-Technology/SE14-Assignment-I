				<p>In science, a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically as in a mathematical or chemical formula.<p>
 				The informal use of the term formula in science refers to the general construct of a relationship between given quantities.<p>
 				The plural of formula can be spelled either as formulas or formulae (from the original Latin).
				some chemical and<p> mathematical formulas of science are as follows.
				<p><center>NaOH + HCl======> NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O</center>
				<p>when <i>sodium hydroxide(NaOH)</i> is reacted with <i>hydrochloric acid(HCl)</i> it gives
				salt <em><b>sodium chloride(NaCl) </b></em> and <i>water H<sub>2</sub>O</i>
				<p><center>(a + b) <sup> 2 </sup>  ==>  a <sup> 2 </sup> + 2.a.b + b <sup> 2 </sup></center>
				<p>In this formula it says the whole square of <em><b>( a + b )</b></em> gives <i>a<sup>2</sup>+2.a.b+b<sup>2</sup></i>
