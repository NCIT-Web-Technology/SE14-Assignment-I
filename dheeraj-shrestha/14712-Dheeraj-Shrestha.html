<a id="sec1"><li><h2>When were computers used first?</h2></li>


The word <b>computer</b> comes from the phrase <i>to compute</i> or <i>to calculate</i>.Tools that help calculation,such as abacus,have been around foe the past 3000 years,but electronic computers that can perform complicated tasks at lightning speed  appeared only about 70 years ago.Today the world can no longer be imagined without computers. The heart of the computer is <b>CPU</b>,the central procesing unit.It controls all the processes in the computer.Computer knows only two switching states,which are expressed by numbers: 1 stands for <i>power on</i> and 0 stands for <i>power off</i>.Computers therefore calculate ones and zeroes.Later in 1969, some American Universities and research institutes needed more computing powers, and connected their computer with one another.Later more and more computers got connected, giving rise to a worldwide network called the <b>internet</b>.
<a id="sec2"><li><h2>Computer Viruses:</h2></li>
<p>Like any other field in computer science, viruses have evolved -a great deal indeed- over the years. In the series of press releases which start today, we will look at the origins and evolution of malicious code since it first appeared up to the present.

Going back to the origin of viruses, it was in 1949 that Mathematician John Von Neumann described self-replicating programs which could resemble computer viruses as they are known today. However, it was not until the 60s that we find the predecessor of current viruses. In that decade, a group of programmers developed a game called Core Wars, which could reproduce every time it was run, and even saturate the memory of other players' computers. The creators of this peculiar game also created the first antivirus, an application named Reeper, which could destroy copies created by Core Wars.I hate <strike><b>viruses</b></strike>.</p>
