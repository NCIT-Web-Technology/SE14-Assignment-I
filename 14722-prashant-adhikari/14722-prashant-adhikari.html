	<h2><a name="friend">Friends Make Every Day A Party</a></h2>
	<p> Friendship is a <em><strong>relationship of mutual affection</strong></em> between two or more people. Friendship is a stronger 	form of interpersonal bond than an <b><i>association</i></b>. Friendship has been studied in academic fields such as 	sociology, 	social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. A World Happiness Database study found that people with close 		friendships are happier.Although there are many forms of <strong>friendship</strong>, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of friendship. Such characteristics include affection, sympathy, empathy, honesty, altruism,<strike>hate</strike> mutual understanding and compassion, enjoyment of each other's company, trust, and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend.

While there is no practical limit on what types of people can form a friendship, friends tend to share common backgrounds, occupations, or interests, and have similar demographics.</p>

	<dl>
	<dt>HTTP:</dt>
	<dd>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for 	distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.HTTP is the 			foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

	Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between 	nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer 			hypertext.The standards development of HTTP was coordinated by the 			Internet 	Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web 	Consortium 		(W3C), 	culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for 		Comments 	(RFCs). 	The first definition of HTTP/1.1, the 	version of 	HTTP in 	common 	use, 	occurre in RFC 2068 in 1997, although 	this was 	obsoleted by 	RFC 2616 	in 	1999.</dd>
	
	<dt>FTP:</dt>
	<dd>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used 		to transfer computer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based 		network, such as the Internet.

	FTP is built on a client-server architecture and uses separate control 		and data connections between the client and the server.FTP users may 		authenticate themselves using a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in 		the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the 		server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects 		the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured 		with SSL/TLS (FTPS). SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is sometimes also 		used instead, but is technologically different.

	The first FTP client applications were command-line applications 		developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are 		still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems.Many 		FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for 			desktops, 	servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been 			incorporated into productivity applications, such as Web page editors. 			</dd>

	<dt>SMTP:</dt>
	<dd>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for 		electronic mail (email) transmission. First defined by RFC 821 in 1982, 		it was last updated in 2008 with the Extended SMTP additions by RFC 5321		—which is the protocol in widespread use today.

	SMTP by default uses TCP port 25. The protocol for mail submission is the 	same, but uses port 587. SMTP connections secured by SSL, known as SMTPS, 	default to port 465 (nonstandard, but sometimes used for legacy reasons).

	Although electronic mail servers and other mail transfer agents use SMTP 		to send and receive mail messages, user-level client mail applications 			typically 	use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for 	relaying. 	For 	receiving messages, client applications usually use either 	POP3 or 		IMAP.

	Although proprietary systems (such as Microsoft Exchange and IBM Notes) 		and webmail systems (such as Outlook.com, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail) use 			their own 	non-standard protocols to access mail box accounts on their own 			mail 	servers, all use SMTP when sending or receiving email from outside 			their own 	systems.</dd>
