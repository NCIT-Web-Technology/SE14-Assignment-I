One writer notes how popular the site has become in a short time. She writes, "When Facebook launched in February 2004, American college students seized the opportunity to have a new social medium" (Lingg, 2008). Today, millions of new visitors join the site every year, and people find relatives, old friends, new friends, and much more as they surf the entries of neighbors, acquaintances, and classmates.</i></p>
